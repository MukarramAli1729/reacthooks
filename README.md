# Demo

Start from two simple approaches working side by side.
A functional component and a class component.
One Checkbox and a label in each component.

1. Implement toggle checkbox feature in both component with different approach.
2. Add a strike on text. And toggle it with checkbox
3. Add a timer component in both files.
4. On mount, start decreasing the time left, until it is 0.
5. Make a custom hook, and finally give a completely built dynamic variable without using state.
6. Restart timer on checkbox click
7. Use window innerWidth. How can we remove component life cycles and make a behavior logic stay in one place.
